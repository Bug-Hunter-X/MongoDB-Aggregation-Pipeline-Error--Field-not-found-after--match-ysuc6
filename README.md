# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines where a field used in the `$group` stage is not present in the documents after the `$match` stage. This can lead to unexpected results or errors.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a field is used in the `$group` stage of an aggregation pipeline, but that field is not included in the documents that pass through the preceding `$match` stage. In such cases, the aggregation pipeline will either produce unexpected results or throw an error indicating that the field is not found.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that the field used in `$group` is either present in the documents processed by the `$match` stage or is explicitly projected using the `$project` stage before the `$group` stage.
